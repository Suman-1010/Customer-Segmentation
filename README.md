# Customer-Segmentation
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

To develop a machine learning model that can identify and group customers based on their shopping patterns and behavior. The model should use customer data such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score to segment customers into different groups. This segmentation will enable mall owners to target their marketing efforts more effectively, improve customer experience, and optimize their business operations.
Malls or shopping complexes are often indulged in the race to increase their customers and hence making huge profits. To achieve this task machine learning is being applied by many stores already. It is amazing to realize the fact that how machine learning can aid in such ambitions. The shopping complexes make use of their customersâ€™ data and develop ML models to target the right ones. This not only increases sales but also makes the complexes efficient.
This Project is a Segementaion of mall customers into different groups based upon their 'CustomerID',	'Genre',	'Age',	'Annual Income (k$)',	'Spending Score (1-100)' using K Means Clustering Algorithm.

Methods Used:
1.Elbow Method
2.Average Silhouette Method
Feature Engineering
Machine Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Data Visualization

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is mall-customers-data.csv. It contains 200 rows and 5 columns:
customer_id: unique ID assigned to the customer.
genre: gender of the customer (male or female).
age: age of the customer.
Annual Income(k$): annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
spending_score: score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

Technologies:
Python
Conclusion:
In conclusion, this Python project on customer segmentation using k-means clustering provides a practical framework for businesses seeking to categorize their customers based on shared characteristics. By employing the average silhouette method, we can determine an optimal number of clusters. The README offers comprehensive guidance on project setup, methodology, and results interpretation, making it accessible to both developers and business stakeholders. This project empowers users to understand their customer base more effectively, enabling data-driven decision-making and tailored marketing strategies. As customer segmentation remains integral to numerous industries, this project serves as a valuable resource for enhancing customer-focused strategies and business growth.
